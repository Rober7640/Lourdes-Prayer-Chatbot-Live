### Email 3: Check-In (+30 Days)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `Thinking of you`
- B: `{{user_name}}, how are you?`
- C: `A note from Sister Marie`

**From:** Sister Marie <marie@messengersoflourldes.com>

**Body:**

```
Dear {{user_name}},

It's been about a month since your prayer was placed at the Grotto.

I wanted to check in. How are things?

Sometimes people write back to tell me what's happened — a small shift, an unexpected peace, a door that opened. Sometimes nothing visible has changed, but something inside feels different.

Whatever your experience has been, know that prayer works in its own time.

You remain in my intentions.

With warmth,
Sister Marie

### Email 4: Re-engagement (+90 Days)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `The Lourdes Blessing Pack`
- B: `{{user_name}}, bring Lourdes into your home`
- C: `A gift of faith for you or someone you love`

**From:** Sister Marie <marie@messengersoflourldes.com>

**Body:**

```
Dear {{user_name}},

It's been a few months since we prayed together, and I've been thinking of you.

I wanted to share something new we've created — the Lourdes Blessing Pack.

It contains two sacred items from our pilgrimages: a bottle with 10ml of holy water from the Grotto, and a keychain with a small capsule of Lourdes water inside — so you can carry Our Lady's blessing wherever you go.

Many people keep the bottle in their home and the keychain close to them. Others give them as gifts to family members going through difficult times.

If this speaks to you, I'd be honored to send one your way.

And if another prayer intention has come to your heart, the Grotto is always waiting.

God bless you, {{user_name}}.

### Email 3: Medal Follow-Up (+14 Days)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: `Has your medal arrived?`
- B: `{{user_name}}, checking in on your delivery`
- C: `Your Lourdes medal`

**From:** Sister Marie <marie@messengersoflourldes.com>

**Body:**

```
Dear {{user_name}},

I wanted to check — has your Lourdes Healing Medal arrived?

Most packages from France take 7-14 days, though sometimes customs adds a few extra days.

If it's arrived, I hope it's brought you comfort. Many people keep theirs close — on a nightstand, in a pocket, or worn around the neck. There's no right way. The blessing travels with it wherever it goes.

If you haven't received it yet and it's been more than 14 days, please let me know and I'll look into it for you.

With care,
Sister Marie
